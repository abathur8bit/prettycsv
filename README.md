# Pretty CSV
Format comma separated lists as a space separated list with constant width columns. Perfect for when you want to copy output from a database into an email and want to have it readable.

For example, enter the following: 

```
id,name,amount
1,Bob,3.14
2,Franko,45
```

And Pretty CSV will convert it to:

```
id name   amount 
1  Bob    3.14   
2  Franko 45     
```
